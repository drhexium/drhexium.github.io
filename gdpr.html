            <p>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safety measures of advanced technology according to the
              legal and technical requirements for personal data protection from non-authorized access or intrusion.
              Such measures include the implementation of specialized technologies and processes to safeguard your
              privacy, as for example secure servers, fire walls, etc. We always adhere to the current legal and
              compliance framework and provisions regarding the confidentiality and security of personal data.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>WHOM WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH</strong>
            <p>Personal data taken from job applications, curriculum vitae and the related provided documentation is
              accessed only by authorized personnel of the Company. We might share personal data with the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Our affiliate companies abroad. In such a case, these companies will process your personal data for
                the same purposes and with the same conditions as described in this policy.</li>
              <li>Third parties that process your data in relation to a service provided to us, e.g. headhunting, job
                posting, reference checking, always within the framework of the purposes of data processing as described
                in this policy.</li>
              <li>Service providers (e.g. payroll outsourced company, cloud services, etc.) who have been instructed by

            <p>By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storage or processing.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FOR HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong>
            <p>By completing the application and submitting or sending your CV, we inform you that the retention period
              of the application and all related documentation does not exceed 1 year after the date of submission.
              After this period the submitted documents will be destroyed and/or deleted in a safe way, unless the
              Company is legally entitled or obliged to keep them. The latter occurs especially in the case that the
              party interested to be hired or cooperate, etc. is finally hired by or collaborates with the Company, so
              the respective documentation will be retained as long as the cooperation is active. Also, any additional
              information that is requested and is necessary for the needs of the social insurance-tax legislation, will
              be processed only for purposes directly related to the cooperation of the interested party. Once the
              employment contract or the period of cooperation is terminated or expires, the respective data will be
              kept for as long as the legislation requires and for the maximum period of limitation of the claims of
              both parties, and then they will be destroyed and/or deleted in a safe way.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS AS REGARDS THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong>
            <p>You have the right to submit a request to the Company to access, correct, delete or restrict processing
              of your data, the right to object to the processing, the right to portability, but also the right to
              revocation of consent, without prejudice to the legality of the processing based on the consent before
              revocation. These rights may be exercised either by sending a letter to the address of the Company as
              indicated in this policy or by email to hr@adveos.com. The Company will take all possible measures to
              satisfy this request within one month of its reception and to inform the requestor about the progress of
              the request, any delay or extension or about the reasons making satisfaction of their request impossible.
              The requestor will need to provide the description of the data as well as the full name and the ID details
              for the necessary identification.</p>
